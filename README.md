# SOCIO
 Socio is a feature-rich social media web app developed within three months. I contributed to both front-end and back-end development using Django, HTML, CSS, and Python. Key features include user messaging, friend list management, and network control. The app utilizes SQLite for data storage, ensuring efficient data handling and seamless user interactions.
